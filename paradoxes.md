## Mathematical & Statistical Paradoxes

### 1. Potato Paradox (559 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_paradox)

The potato paradox is a mathematical calculation that has a counter-intuitive result. If you have 100 lbs of potatoes that are 99% water, and you let them dry until they are 98% water, they now weigh only 50 lbs.

**Why it's surprising:** A 1% change in water content results in a 50% reduction in weight.

### 2. Simpson's Paradox (370+ points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)

A trend that appears in several groups of data disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. A treatment can appear better in every subgroup but worse overall.

**Example:** Drug A might be better for both men AND women separately, but Drug B appears better when you combine the data.

---

### 3. St. Petersburg Paradox (144 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox)

A gambling game with infinite expected value that no rational person would pay much to play. Flip a coin until tails - you win $2^n where n is the number of flips.

**Expected value:** Infinite, yet most people would only pay a few dollars to play.

---

### 4. Two Capacitor Paradox (438 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_capacitor_paradox)

When charge is transferred between two capacitors, energy appears to be lost even in an ideal circuit with no resistance. Where does the energy go?

**Resolution:** Energy is lost to electromagnetic radiation or the idealization is physically impossible.

---

### 5. Banach-Tarski Paradox (97 points)
**Source:** [Bill Wadge's Blog](https://billwadge.wordpress.com/2017/06/12/thanks-axiom-of-choice-the-banachtarski-paradox/)

Using the Axiom of Choice, a solid ball can be decomposed into a finite number of pieces and reassembled into two balls identical to the original.

### 6. Braess' Paradox (98 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27_paradox)

Adding a new road to a traffic network can actually increase overall journey time for all drivers. Removing roads can sometimes improve traffic flow.

---

## Physics & Time Paradoxes

### 7. Fermi Paradox (223 points)
**Source:** [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)

Given the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations, why have we found no evidence of them? The universe is old enough and large enough that we should have detected something by now.

**Possible explanations:** Great Filter, Zoo hypothesis, Dark Forest theory, they're already here...

---

### 8. Grandfather Paradox (154 points)
**Source:** [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-travel-simulation-resolves-grandfather-paradox/)

If you travel back in time and prevent your grandfather from meeting your grandmother, you would never be born - so you couldn't have traveled back in time to prevent it.

**Resolution:** Self-consistent timelines, many-worlds interpretation.

---

### 9. Olbers' Paradox (264 points)
**Source:** [AMNH](http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/cs_paradox.html)

If the universe is infinite, eternal, and static, the night sky should be as bright as the surface of the sun. Every line of sight should eventually hit a star.

**Resolution:** The universe is not infinite in age - light from distant stars hasn't reached us yet.

---

### 10. Black Hole Information Paradox (96 points)
**Source:** [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-black-hole-information-paradox-comes-to-an-end/)

When matter falls into a black hole and the black hole eventually evaporates via Hawking radiation, what happens to the information contained in that matter? Quantum mechanics says information cannot be destroyed.

---

### 11. Archer's Paradox (276 points)
**Source:** [Video](https://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=2518042)

An arrow shot from a bow must flex around the bow's handle to hit a target directly in front. The arrow bends in flight to correct its path.

## Social & Economic Paradoxes

### 12. Friendship Paradox (288 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox)

On average, your friends have more friends than you do. This is a mathematical certainty due to sampling bias - you're more likely to be friends with popular people.

---

### 13. Jevons Paradox (98 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

Increasing efficiency in resource use often leads to INCREASED total consumption, not decreased. Better fuel efficiency in cars leads to more driving.

---

### 14. Waiting Time Paradox (345 points)
**Source:** [Jake VanderPlas Blog](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2018/09/13/waiting-time-paradox/)

On average, you'll wait longer for a bus than the scheduled interval suggests. If buses come every 10 minutes on average, your expected wait is longer than 5 minutes.

**Why:** You're more likely to arrive during a long gap than a short one.

---

### 15. Commuting Paradox (140 points)
**Source:** [Research PDF](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/20544/1/dp1278.pdf)

People with long commutes report lower life satisfaction, yet millions choose to commute. The additional income doesn't compensate for the lost time and stress.

---

### 16. Free-Time Paradox (257 points)
**Source:** [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/A/archive/2016/09/the-free-time-paradox-in-america/499826/)

Americans have more free time than ever, yet feel more rushed and time-poor. Higher income people have less leisure time but report feeling less busy.

---

### 17. Dating App Paradox (251 points)
**Source:** [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2024/02/13/1228749143/the-dating-app-paradox-why-dating-apps-may-be-worse-than-ever)

Dating apps promise to make finding partners easier, but may actually make dating worse by creating choice overload and commodifying relationships.

---

### 18. Eligible Bachelor Paradox (94 points)
**Source:** [Slate](http://www.slate.com/id/2188684/pagenum/all/)

Why do all the good men/women seem to be taken? Selection bias and the stable marriage problem create a dating market where eligible partners are rare.

---

### 19. Silicon Valley Hunger Paradox (151 points)
**Source:** [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/the-silicon-valley-paradox-one-in-four-people-are-at-risk-of-hunger)

In one of the world's wealthiest regions, one in four people face food insecurity. Extreme wealth concentration and cost of living create invisible poverty.

## Technology & Computing Paradoxes

### 20. Moravec's Paradox (155 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox)

Tasks that are easy for humans (walking, recognizing faces) are hard for computers. Tasks hard for humans (chess, mathematics) are easy for computers.

**Reason:** Evolution has optimized us for sensorimotor tasks over millions of years.

---

### 21. Python Paradox (148 points)
**Source:** [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html)

A company that uses Python will be able to hire better programmers. Programmers who learn Python do it because they want to, not because they have to.

---

### 22. Static Site Paradox (546 points)
**Source:** [Kristoff's Blog](https://kristoff.it/blog/static-site-paradox/)

Static sites are supposed to be simpler, but modern static site generators have become incredibly complex. The tooling to avoid complexity has become complex itself.

---

### 23. Open Source Paradox (368 points)
**Source:** [Antirez Blog](http://antirez.com/news/134)

Open source projects that become too successful face sustainability challenges. The more users, the more demands, but rarely proportionally more contributors or funding.

---

### 24. Miserable Programmer Paradox (154 points)
**Source:** [Blog Post](http://blog.garlicsim.org/post/2840398276/the-miserable-programmer-paradox)

The best programmers are often miserable because they see how bad most code is and how much better things could be. Ignorance might be bliss in programming.

---

### 25. Solow Paradox (97 points)
**Source:** [Scott Locklin Blog](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2023/11/21/computers-reduce-efficiency-case-studies-of-the-solow-paradox/)

"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." Despite massive IT investment, productivity gains have been disappointing.

---

### 26. Tog's Paradox (260 points)
**Source:** [Votito](https://www.votito.com/methods/togs-paradox/)

Users believe they're faster with keyboard shortcuts, but studies show mouse users are often faster. The feeling of speed doesn't match actual performance.

---

## Scientific & Philosophical Paradoxes

### 27. Peto's Paradox (142 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peto%27s_paradox)

Large animals like elephants and whales should have much higher cancer rates (more cells = more chances for cancer), but they don't. Elephants rarely get cancer.

**Explanation:** They've evolved multiple copies of tumor-suppressor genes.

---

### 28. Karl Popper Paradox (147 points)
**Source:** [Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-paradox-of-karl-popper/)

Popper advocated for tolerance but argued we must be intolerant of intolerance. A tolerant society cannot tolerate those who would destroy tolerance.

---

### 29. Efficient Market Paradox (95 points)
**Source:** [3 Quarks Daily](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2024/09/the-paradoxical-efficient-market-hypothesis.html)

If markets are perfectly efficient, there's no incentive to analyze stocks. But if no one analyzes stocks, markets can't be efficient. The hypothesis undermines itself.

---

### 30. Deming Paradox (283 points)
**Source:** [Commoncog](https://commoncog.com/deming-paradox-operational-rigour/)

Operationally rigorous companies often aren't nice places to work. The very practices that make companies efficient can make them unpleasant for employees.
