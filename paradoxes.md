## Mathematical & Statistical Paradoxes

### 1. Potato Paradox (559 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_paradox)

The potato paradox is a mathematical calculation that has a counter-intuitive result. If you have 100 lbs of potatoes that are 99% water, and you let them dry until they are 98% water, they now weigh only 50 lbs.

**Why it's surprising:** A 1% change in water content results in a 50% reduction in weight.

---

### 2. Simpson's Paradox (370+ points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)

A trend that appears in several groups of data disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. A treatment can appear better in every subgroup but worse overall.

**Example:** Drug A might be better for both men AND women separately, but Drug B appears better when you combine the data.

---

### 3. St. Petersburg Paradox (144 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox)

A gambling game with infinite expected value that no rational person would pay much to play. Flip a coin until tails - you win $2^n where n is the number of flips.

**Expected value:** Infinite, yet most people would only pay a few dollars to play.

---

### 4. Two Capacitor Paradox (438 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_capacitor_paradox)

When charge is transferred between two capacitors, energy appears to be lost even in an ideal circuit with no resistance. Where does the energy go?

**Resolution:** Energy is lost to electromagnetic radiation or the idealization is physically impossible.

---

### 5. Banach-Tarski Paradox (97 points)
**Source:** [Bill Wadge's Blog](https://billwadge.wordpress.com/2017/06/12/thanks-axiom-of-choice-the-banachtarski-paradox/)

Using the Axiom of Choice, a solid ball can be decomposed into a finite number of pieces and reassembled into two balls identical to the original.

---

### 6. Braess' Paradox (98 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27_paradox)

Adding a new road to a traffic network can actually increase overall journey time for all drivers. Removing roads can sometimes improve traffic flow.

---

## Physics & Time Paradoxes

### 7. Fermi Paradox (223 points)
**Source:** [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)

Given the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations, why have we found no evidence of them? The universe is old enough and large enough that we should have detected something by now.

**Possible explanations:** Great Filter, Zoo hypothesis, Dark Forest theory, they're already here...

---

### 8. Grandfather Paradox (154 points)
**Source:** [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-travel-simulation-resolves-grandfather-paradox/)

If you travel back in time and prevent your grandfather from meeting your grandmother, you would never be born - so you couldn't have traveled back in time to prevent it.

**Resolution:** Self-consistent timelines, many-worlds interpretation.

---

### 9. Olbers' Paradox (264 points)
**Source:** [AMNH](http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/cs_paradox.html)

If the universe is infinite, eternal, and static, the night sky should be as bright as the surface of the sun. Every line of sight should eventually hit a star.

**Resolution:** The universe is not infinite in age - light from distant stars hasn't reached us yet.

---

### 10. Black Hole Information Paradox (96 points)
**Source:** [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-black-hole-information-paradox-comes-to-an-end/)

When matter falls into a black hole and the black hole eventually evaporates via Hawking radiation, what happens to the information contained in that matter? Quantum mechanics says information cannot be destroyed.

---

### 11. Archer's Paradox (276 points)
**Source:** [Video](https://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=2518042)

An arrow shot from a bow must flex around the bow's handle to hit a target directly in front. The arrow bends in flight to correct its path.

---

## Social & Economic Paradoxes

### 12. Friendship Paradox (288 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox)

On average, your friends have more friends than you do. This is a mathematical certainty due to sampling bias - you're more likely to be friends with popular people.

---

### 13. Jevons Paradox (98 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

Increasing efficiency in resource use often leads to INCREASED total consumption, not decreased. Better fuel efficiency in cars leads to more driving.

---

### 14. Waiting Time Paradox (345 points)
**Source:** [Jake VanderPlas Blog](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2018/09/13/waiting-time-paradox/)

On average, you'll wait longer for a bus than the scheduled interval suggests. If buses come every 10 minutes on average, your expected wait is longer than 5 minutes.

**Why:** You're more likely to arrive during a long gap than a short one.

---

### 15. Commuting Paradox (140 points)
**Source:** [Research PDF](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/20544/1/dp1278.pdf)

People with long commutes report lower life satisfaction, yet millions choose to commute. The additional income doesn't compensate for the lost time and stress.

---

### 16. Free-Time Paradox (257 points)
**Source:** [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/A/archive/2016/09/the-free-time-paradox-in-america/499826/)

Americans have more free time than ever, yet feel more rushed and time-poor. Higher income people have less leisure time but report feeling less busy.

---

### 17. Dating App Paradox (251 points)
**Source:** [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2024/02/13/1228749143/the-dating-app-paradox-why-dating-apps-may-be-worse-than-ever)

Dating apps promise to make finding partners easier, but may actually make dating worse by creating choice overload and commodifying relationships.

---

### 18. Eligible Bachelor Paradox (94 points)
**Source:** [Slate](http://www.slate.com/id/2188684/pagenum/all/)

Why do all the good men/women seem to be taken? Selection bias and the stable marriage problem create a dating market where eligible partners are rare.

---

### 19. Silicon Valley Hunger Paradox (151 points)
**Source:** [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/the-silicon-valley-paradox-one-in-four-people-are-at-risk-of-hunger)

In one of the world's wealthiest regions, one in four people face food insecurity. Extreme wealth concentration and cost of living create invisible poverty.

---

## Technology & Computing Paradoxes

### 20. Moravec's Paradox (155 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox)

Tasks that are easy for humans (walking, recognizing faces) are hard for computers. Tasks hard for humans (chess, mathematics) are easy for computers.

**Reason:** Evolution has optimized us for sensorimotor tasks over millions of years.

---

### 21. Python Paradox (148 points)
**Source:** [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html)

A company that uses Python will be able to hire better programmers. Programmers who learn Python do it because they want to, not because they have to.

---

### 22. Static Site Paradox (546 points)
**Source:** [Kristoff's Blog](https://kristoff.it/blog/static-site-paradox/)

Static sites are supposed to be simpler, but modern static site generators have become incredibly complex. The tooling to avoid complexity has become complex itself.

---

### 23. Open Source Paradox (368 points)
**Source:** [Antirez Blog](http://antirez.com/news/134)

Open source projects that become too successful face sustainability challenges. The more users, the more demands, but rarely proportionally more contributors or funding.

---

**Source:** [Blog Post](http://blog.garlicsim.org/post/2840398276/the-miserable-programmer-paradox)

The best programmers are often miserable because they see how bad most code is and how much better things could be. Ignorance might be bliss in programming.

---

### 25. Solow Paradox (97 points)
**Source:** [Scott Locklin Blog](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2023/11/21/computers-reduce-efficiency-case-studies-of-the-solow-paradox/)

"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." Despite massive IT investment, productivity gains have been disappointing.

---

### 26. Tog's Paradox (260 points)
**Source:** [Votito](https://www.votito.com/methods/togs-paradox/)

Users believe they're faster with keyboard shortcuts, but studies show mouse users are often faster. The feeling of speed doesn't match actual performance.

---

## Scientific & Philosophical Paradoxes

### 27. Peto's Paradox (142 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peto%27s_paradox)

Large animals like elephants and whales should have much higher cancer rates (more cells = more chances for cancer), but they don't. Elephants rarely get cancer.

**Explanation:** They've evolved multiple copies of tumor-suppressor genes.

---

### 28. Karl Popper Paradox (147 points)
**Source:** [Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-paradox-of-karl-popper/)

Popper advocated for tolerance but argued we must be intolerant of intolerance. A tolerant society cannot tolerate those who would destroy tolerance.

---

### 29. Efficient Market Paradox (95 points)
**Source:** [3 Quarks Daily](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2024/09/the-paradoxical-efficient-market-hypothesis.html)

If markets are perfectly efficient, there's no incentive to analyze stocks. But if no one analyzes stocks, markets can't be efficient. The hypothesis undermines itself.

---

### 30. Deming Paradox (283 points)
**Source:** [Commoncog](https://commoncog.com/deming-paradox-operational-rigour/)

Operationally rigorous companies often aren't nice places to work. The very practices that make companies efficient can make them unpleasant for employees.

---

---

## Probability & Logic Paradoxes (NEW)

### 31. Birthday Paradox (86 points)
**Source:** [Data Genetics](http://datagenetics.com/blog/february72019/index.html)

In a room of just 23 people, there's a 50% chance two people share a birthday. With 70 people, it's 99.9% certain.

**Why it's surprising:** We intuitively think of 365 days and expect ~183 people needed.

---

### 32. Berkson's Paradox (87 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox)

Selection bias can create spurious correlations. If you only look at hospitalized patients, diseases that aren't related can appear correlated because both increase hospitalization risk.

**Example:** Among Hollywood actors, talent and attractiveness appear negatively correlated - but only because you need at least one to get selected.

---

### 33. Sleeping Beauty Paradox (77 points)
**Source:** [Stack Exchange](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/41208/the-sleeping-beauty-paradox)

Sleeping Beauty is put to sleep. A coin is flipped: if heads, she's woken once; if tails, twice (with memory erased between). When she wakes, what probability should she assign to heads?

**Debate:** Is it 1/2 (the coin is fair) or 1/3 (she's more likely to be in a tails timeline)?

---

### 34. Unexpected Hanging Paradox (77 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox)

A judge tells a prisoner: "You will be hanged next week on a day you don't expect." The prisoner reasons he can't be hanged Friday (he'd expect it), then Thursday, etc. He concludes he can't be hanged - then is surprised on Wednesday.

---

### 35. Newcomb's Paradox (54 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox)

A predictor (nearly always correct) has put $1M in Box B if they predicted you'd take only Box B, or $0 if they predicted you'd take both boxes. Box A always has $1K. Do you take both boxes or just Box B?

**Debate:** Game theory says take both; decision theory says take only B.

---

### 36. Parrondo's Paradox (69 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrondo%27s_paradox)

Two losing games can combine into a winning strategy. Like a ratchet mechanism, alternating between specific losing strategies can produce overall gains.

---

### 37. Raven Paradox (69 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_paradox)

"All ravens are black" is logically equivalent to "all non-black things are non-ravens." So seeing a green apple should confirm that all ravens are black. But that seems absurd!

---

### 38. Monty Hall Problem (implicit, widely discussed)
**Source:** Classic probability puzzle

You pick a door (1 of 3). The host opens another door showing a goat. Should you switch? Yes - switching gives 2/3 probability of winning the car.

---

## Infinity & Set Theory Paradoxes (NEW)

### 39. Hilbert's Hotel Paradox (60 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel)

A hotel with infinite rooms, all full, can still accommodate infinitely many new guests. Just move guest n to room 2n, freeing all odd-numbered rooms.

---

### 40. Zeno's Paradox (47 points)
**Source:** [Joel David Hamkins](https://joeldavidhamkins.substack.com/p/zenos-paradox)

To reach a destination, you must first travel half the distance, then half of what remains, ad infinitum. How can you ever arrive if you must complete infinite steps?

**Resolution:** Infinite series can have finite sums.

---

### 41. Coastline Paradox (63 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox)

The length of a coastline depends on the measurement scale. Smaller rulers reveal more detail, making the coast longer. As the ruler approaches zero, the length approaches infinity.

---

### 42. Interesting Number Paradox (65 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox)

If some numbers are "uninteresting," then the smallest uninteresting number is interesting by virtue of being smallest. Therefore, no number can be uninteresting.

---

## Decision & Game Theory Paradoxes (NEW)

### 43. Abilene Paradox (42 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox)

A group can collectively decide on a course of action that no individual member actually wants. Everyone assumes others want it, so no one speaks up.

**Example:** A family drives to Abilene in the heat, later discovering no one actually wanted to go.

---

### 44. Paradox of Choice (54 points)
**Source:** [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/science/26tier.html)

Having more options can lead to worse decisions and less satisfaction. Too many choices cause decision paralysis and regret about paths not taken.

---

### 45. Willpower Paradox (91 points)
**Source:** [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-willpower-paradox)

Exerting willpower depletes it, making future self-control harder. But believing willpower is unlimited makes it more available. The belief shapes the reality.

---

### 46. Bonini's Paradox (88 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonini%27s_paradox)

As a model becomes more complete and realistic, it becomes harder to understand. A perfect model of a system would be as complex as the system itself.

---

### 47. Polanyi's Paradox (88 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polanyi%E2%80%99s_paradox)

"We know more than we can tell." Much human knowledge is tacit and cannot be explicitly stated, which is why many human skills are hard to automate.

---

## Identity & Philosophy Paradoxes (NEW)

### 48. Ship of Theseus / Teletransportation (42 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox)

If you replace every plank of a ship, is it the same ship? If a teleporter destroys you and recreates an exact copy, is that "you"?

---

### 49. Bootstrap Paradox (from time travel discussions)
**Source:** Related to Grandfather Paradox

Information or objects exist without being created. You travel back and give Beethoven his symphonies. Who composed them? The loop has no origin.

---

### 50. Sorites Paradox (59 points)
**Source:** [Stanford Encyclopedia](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sorites-paradox/)

Removing one grain from a heap still leaves a heap. But repeat enough times and you have no heap. When exactly does it stop being a heap?

---

## Relativity & Physics Paradoxes (NEW from pages 6-10)

### 51. Ladder Paradox (31 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_paradox)

A ladder moving at relativistic speed appears shorter (length contraction). Can a 20-foot ladder fit in a 10-foot garage? From the garage's frame, yes. From the ladder's frame, the garage is even shorter! Both are correct due to relativity of simultaneity.

---

### 52. Two Envelopes Paradox (43 points)
**Source:** [Mark Dominus Blog](http://blog.plover.com/math/envelope.html)

You're given two envelopes, one with twice as much money as the other. You pick one and can switch. Switching seems always beneficial (50% chance of doubling, 50% chance of halving = positive expected value). But that can't be right!

---

### 53. Tea Leaf Paradox (12 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_leaf_paradox)

When you stir tea, why do the leaves gather in the CENTER of the bottom, not the edges? Einstein explained this in 1926 - it's due to secondary flow patterns, not centrifugal force as expected.

---

### 54. Boy/Girl Paradox (8 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_Girl_paradox)

"I have two children. At least one is a boy. What's the probability both are boys?" Intuition says 1/2, but the answer is 1/3. The phrasing matters enormously!

---

### 55. Ant on a Rubber Rope (9 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_on_a_rubber_rope)

An ant crawls at 1 cm/s on a rubber rope that stretches 1 km/s. Will it ever reach the end? Surprisingly, YES - though it takes longer than the age of the universe. The harmonic series diverges!

---

### 56. Russell's Paradox (10 points)
**Source:** [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/par-russ/)

Consider the set of all sets that don't contain themselves. Does it contain itself? If yes, then it shouldn't. If no, then it should. This paradox broke naive set theory and forced the creation of axiomatic set theory.

---

### 57. Dome Paradox (10 points)
**Source:** [Norton's Dome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjZB81jCGj4)

A ball resting on top of a special dome shape can spontaneously start moving without any cause, according to Newtonian mechanics. This challenges our assumption that Newton's laws are deterministic!

---

### 58. Paradox of Hedonism (10 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_hedonism)

Directly pursuing happiness often fails to achieve it. Happiness is a byproduct of meaningful activities, not something that can be directly obtained. "Those who seek happiness never find it."

---

### 59. Service Recovery Paradox (14 points)
**Source:** [Krit Blog](http://blog.krit.com/post/28124453588/the-service-recovery-paradox)

Customers who experience a problem that gets resolved excellently become MORE loyal than customers who never had a problem. A well-handled failure beats flawless service!

---

### 60. Clothesline Paradox (12 points)
**Source:** [Edge.org](http://edge.org/conversation/-39the-clothesline-paradox-39-)

When you dry clothes on a clothesline instead of a dryer, you've reduced energy consumption - but GDP goes DOWN because you bought less electricity. Our economic metrics punish efficiency!

---

### 61. Necktie Paradox (19 points)
**Source:** [Mind Your Decisions](http://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2009/12/15/the-necktie-paradox/)

Two men bet on who has the more expensive necktie - winner takes both. Each reasons: "If I lose, I lose my tie. If I win, I gain a MORE expensive tie. So the bet favors me!" But both can't be right.

---

### 62. Stability-Instability Paradox (8 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability%E2%80%93instability_paradox)

Nuclear weapons create strategic stability (no one starts a nuclear war) but tactical instability (countries engage in smaller conflicts knowing they won't escalate to nuclear). MAD has limits.

---

### 63. Eigen's Paradox (10 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_threshold_(evolution))

Life needs long genomes to code for accurate replication machinery. But accurate replication machinery is needed to maintain long genomes. How did life bootstrap itself?

---

### 65. Hispanic Paradox (24 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_paradox)

Hispanic Americans have better health outcomes and longer life expectancy than non-Hispanic whites, despite lower average income and education. Cultural factors like family support may explain this.

---

### 66. Automation Paradox (19 points)
**Source:** [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/28/AR2009062802481.html)

The more reliable automated systems become, the less humans practice using them manually. When automation fails, humans are less prepared to take over - making rare failures more catastrophic.

---

### 67. Productivity Paradox / IT Paradox (11 points)
**Source:** [Stanford CS](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/productivity-paradox/background.html)

**Source:** [Startups Blog](http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/2005/01/startups_and_th.html)

Named after Admiral Jim Stockdale: You must maintain unwavering faith that you will prevail in the end AND confront the most brutal facts of your current reality. Optimists who denied reality died first in POW camps.

---

### 69. Blub Paradox (19 points)
**Source:** [Oliver Steele Blog](http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides)

Programmers using a "Blub" language can see the power of less powerful languages but are blind to features of more powerful ones. You can't see what you're missing if you've never experienced it.

---

### 70. Overconfidence Paradox (16 points)
**Source:** [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2009/07/the_overconfidence_paradox.cfm)

Experts often perform worse than simple models because overconfidence leads them to overcomplicate predictions. Knowing more can make you wrong more often.

---

### 71. Diversity-Innovation Paradox (17 points)
**Source:** [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/10/1915378117)

Diverse teams produce more innovative research but receive less credit for it. Papers by diverse teams are cited less and authors promoted more slowly, despite producing more novel work.

---

### 72. Paradoxical Slowness of Human Behavior (11 points)
**Source:** [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/thinking-slowly-the-paradoxical-slowness-of-human-behavior)

---

### 74. Authenticity Paradox (9 points)
**Source:** [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox)

"Being yourself" as a leader often means staying in your comfort zone and not growing. True leadership requires adapting and playing roles that may initially feel inauthentic.

---

### 75. Apportionment Paradox (7 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_paradox)

In proportional representation systems, adding more seats can cause a state/party to LOSE representation. Alabama once lost a congressional seat when the total number of seats increased!

---

### 76. Paradox of Thrift (6 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift)

If everyone saves more during a recession, aggregate demand falls, making the recession worse. Individual prudence becomes collective disaster.

---

### 77. Dollar Auction Paradox (6 points)
**Source:** [Math PDF](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mpugh/Teaching/Sci199_03/dollar_auction_1.pdf)

An auction where bidders pay their bids even if they lose. Rational players get trapped into escalating bids far beyond the prize's value to avoid "wasting" their sunk costs.

---

### 78. Preparedness Paradox (6 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preparedness_paradox)

When disaster preparation works, the disaster doesn't happen (or is minor), making the preparation look like an overreaction. Y2K is often mocked, but massive effort prevented real problems.

---

### 79. Grelling-Nelson Paradox (7 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grelling–Nelson_paradox)

A word is "autological" if it describes itself (e.g., "short" is short). Is "heterological" (doesn't describe itself) heterological? If yes, then no. If no, then yes. A semantic Russell's paradox.

---

### 80. Faint-Sun Paradox (15 points)
**Source:** [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-sun-was-dimmer-when-earth-formed-how-did-life-emerge-20220127/)

The Sun was 30% dimmer when Earth formed, yet liquid water existed. Earth should have been frozen solid. Greenhouse gases and tidal heating may explain early warmth.

---

### 81. Triangle Dissection Paradox (15 points)
**Source:** [Wolfram MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangleDissectionParadox.html)

Cut a triangle into pieces and rearrange them into the "same" shape with a gap or extra square. The illusion works because the "hypotenuse" is actually slightly curved, not straight.

---

### 82. Curry's Paradox (23 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%27s_paradox)

"If this sentence is true, then Santa Claus exists." If the sentence is true, then Santa exists (by modus ponens). This shows that self-reference plus conditional logic breaks everything.

---

### 83. Berry Paradox (9 points)
**Source:** [Greg Chaitin](http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/unm2.html)

"The smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters." This phrase has fewer than sixty letters, so it defines a number that by definition cannot be defined by it. Contradiction!

---

### 91. Newcomb's Paradox (5 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox)

A predictor offers two boxes: Box A (transparent, $1,000) and Box B (opaque, either $1M or $0). The predictor has already decided: if they predicted you'd take both boxes, B is empty; if they predicted you'd take only B, it contains $1M. What do you choose?

---

### 92. Allais Paradox (5 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_paradox)

People's choices in gambles violate expected utility theory. When certainty is an option, we become risk-averse; when it's not, we become risk-seeking. Our preferences are inconsistent.

---

### 93. Ellsberg Paradox (4 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox)

---

### 103. Paradoxical Intention (4 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxical_intention)

A therapy technique: try to do what you fear. Insomniac? Try to stay awake. Anxious? Try to be more anxious. The paradoxical effort often solves the problem.

---

### 106. Paradox of Fiction (4 points)
**Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_fiction)

We feel genuine emotions for fictional characters we know don't exist. How can we fear for someone we know isn't real? What does this say about how emotions work?

---

### 115. AI Deskilling Paradox (4 points)
**Source:** [ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/the-ai-deskilling-paradox/)

As AI handles more tasks, humans lose skills. But when AI fails (and it will), we need those skills most. The more we rely on AI, the less able we are to function without it.
